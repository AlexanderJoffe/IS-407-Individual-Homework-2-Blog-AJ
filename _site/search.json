    "text": "This data set is built-in with tidyr and is pulled from a pew research study from 2007 which asked respondents various questions and then categorized their answers based on religious affiliation. One of these was income and that is what this data set is representing. Its worth noting that these figures are self-reported and some refused to answer.\nWhile different religions had different number of total respondents, by visualizing the data we can come to some conclusions. One of these is that Evangelical Protestants had a greater presence in the &lt;10k category than the &gt;$150k category and Mainline Protestants were the inverse. Atheists, Agnostics, Hindus, Jews, and Catholics were more likely to be in the &gt;$150k category by relatively large margins.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nrelig_income %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=religion, y= `&gt;150k`)) + geom_col(fill=\"red\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 1.2)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1.1))\n\n\n\nrelig_income %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=religion, y= `&lt;$10k`)) + geom_col(fill=\"blue\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 1.2)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1.1))"

    "text": "This data set is part of the forcats package and asks general questions of around 21,000 respondents, covering things like age, religion, party affiliation, and hour spent per day watching TV. For this post, I wanted to look at the mean and median TV hours and see how they differ once separated by age. We can see that the median time spent watching TV is 2 hours and the mean is about 3 hours. For young people, which I categorized as being under 30, their mean is slightly lower than the overall mean and their median is the same. Older people, or those over 30, had more TV hours with a median of 3 and a higher average than the overall mean.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\ngss_cat %&gt;%\n  filter(tvhours&gt;0) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_tv = mean(tvhours),\n            median_tv = median(tvhours))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  mean_tv median_tv\n    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    3.17         2\n\ngss_cat %&gt;%\n  filter(tvhours&gt;0) %&gt;%\n  filter(age&lt;30) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_tv_young = mean(tvhours),\n            median_tv_young = median(tvhours))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  mean_tv_young median_tv_young\n          &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n1          3.04               2\n\ngss_cat %&gt;%\n  filter(tvhours&gt;0) %&gt;%\n  filter(age&gt;30) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_tv_old = mean(tvhours),\n            median_tv_old = median(tvhours))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  mean_tv_old median_tv_old\n        &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        3.21             3"
